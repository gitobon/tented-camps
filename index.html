When we say exclusive, we mean it. It borders the famous Ol Pejeta Conservancy, and our partnership with Pl Pejeta means that our guests have unlimited access to this 90,000-acre wilderness property. The camping experience <strong>Jambo Mutara</strong> offers is unlike any other. Hidden in the midst of deep, thick forests that breathe a life of complete symmetry with nature, this well-crafted piece of art will leave you with an unforgettable experience, Quiet and completely uninterrupted with a calmness of the views of the world it overlooks, Mutara Camp has huge canvas tents with classy modern decor and a blend of African pieces to offer the African feel, Sitting on the private deck of your room or on the reading space gives you the feel of the sights and sounds of nature and the views. Just north of the mystical and ancient Aberdare Forest (a name familiar to Royal watchers as the rather sacred spot Elizabeth became Queen while holidaying Kenya more than 70 years ago) and west of no-less-regal snow-tipped Mount Kenya, Mutara Camp sits serenely on its cliff-top perch, this wild and wonderful setting achieves a true sense of unparalleled romance. We cannot get enough of Mutara Camp plentiful and iconic wildlife viewing, set against the personal service and safari-chic accommodations that make this camp a knockout. These 15 large and gracious canvas tents are furnished to the highest of high standards. (And, as we&rsquo;ve said before, the term tent does them no justice at all.) Consider the beautifully dressed king bed, and the roomy en-suite bathroom with its gloriously high-pressure shower. There&rsquo;s a cozy reading area equipped with Wi-fi and fully stocked minibar to buoy private sundowners on a secluded deck open to the wide African skies. In the dining and lounge tents, richly appointed furnishings are put to fine use as well: rejoice over the day&rsquo;s exciting wildlife sightings amongst soft leather club chairs and glittering chandeliers. Your time at Mutara Camp is curated to ensure personal service operates smoothly and seamlessly in the background while the sights and sounds of the bush play to the fore&mdash;and, in cahoots with your ever-ready safari guides, your every hoped-for comfort and wish is swiftly delivered. All private tents feature a separate living room area that can be easily converted to accommodate 2 single beds, ideal for the use of happy safari-going children. Between glorious game drives rich with loping lions, lanky leopards, big and mighty buffalo, elephant and much, much more, there&rsquo;s ample time for relaxing dips in the swimming pool, life-affirming sundowner toasts overlooking the ancient rituals of the watering hole, and deliciously festive bush dining during our inevitably too-short days at Mutara. Not to be missed: a heartwarming visit to the nearby Chimpanzee Sanctuary and a long, awe-inspiring look at the Conservancy&rsquo;s two rare, protected Northern White Rhinos

The camp is built from canvas and wood with beautiful antiques and silverware giving it the elegance of a bygone era. It overlooks the Mutara where plains game roams freely, and elephants are seen daily. This positioning allows guests to enjoy unhindered views of animals grazing and interacting without being noticed. For a more intimate experience with the wilderness, try one of our bush walks.
